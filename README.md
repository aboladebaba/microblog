# Microblog
An implementation of a functional web blog application for the purpose of learning Flask and also learning the building blocks of creating an application with many of the common functionalites that are used in larger applications. This is a self study exercise I embarked on due to my curiousity to learn flask and web applications. Most of the contetnt here are from the [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) 

## Templates
This section provide implementation logic for templates. You are going to learn how to generate more elaborate web pages that have a complex structure and many dynamic components. 

## Web Forms
Web forms are one of the most basic building blocks in any web application. I will be using forms to allow users to submit blog posts, and also for logging in to the application.

## Database
For most applications, there is going to be a need to maintain persistent data that can be retrieved efficiently, and this is exactly what databases are made for.

## User Logins
This section implements simple user login system. You can leverage the same logic here for a much larger projects.

## User Profile and Avatars
The profiles provide implementation details on how to generate profile pages for all users dynamically. A user profile page is a page in which information about a user is presented, often with information entered by the users themselves.
Avatars: If you are interested in learning about other options offered by the Gravatar service, visit their [documentation website](https://gravatar.com/site/implement/images).
